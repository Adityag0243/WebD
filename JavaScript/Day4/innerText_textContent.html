                                innerText   v/s   textContent
        Use textContent when:
            We want all the text (including text from hidden elements).
            Performance is important, especially when you don't need to worry about layer or CSS visibility.
            We are manipulating raw text, and we don't care about white spaces or hidden elements.
        
        Use innerText when :
            We want to visible text, and we are dealing with text that might have styling (like hidden elements or user interaction).
            We need to respect CSS visibility and layout.
            It is important that the text looks lik eot does on screen, including white screen spaces and line breaks.

    Note : Observe DOM for more clarity
